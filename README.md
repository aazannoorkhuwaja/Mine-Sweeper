# Minesweeper Console Game 

This is a console-based Minesweeper game built using C++. It uses a grid system navigated via X and Y coordinates, allowing users to uncover cells and avoid mines. The game simulates classic Minesweeper mechanics in a terminal/console environment without a graphical interface.

## Features

- Console interface using X,Y axis input  
- Randomized mine placement  
- Simple logic for win/loss conditions  
- Designed for C++ beginners  
- Easy-to-understand code in a single `.cpp` file  

## Project Background

This project was developed as the final project for the **Programming Fundamentals (PF)** course in our **first semester** of BS Computer Science.

### Credits

While the structure and flow of the project were a collaborative effort, **the core logic and gameplay mechanism were built by my classmate and teammate, Munawar**. Huge thanks to him for being a wonderful collaborator throughout the project!
